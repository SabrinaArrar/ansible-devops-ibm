# Important: Treat dro_action and uds_action as an alias for the same thing
# Thus dro_action = "install" doesn't mean "install DRO", it means "install UDS"

# 1. Install DRO
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If the user has provided dro_endpoint_url then it means they don't want to install
# DRO locally, but instead just generate a BASCfg for the instance defined by
# the input variables
- include_tasks: "tasks/{{ dro_action }}/main.yml"
  when:
    - dro_action in ["install_dro", "uninstall"]
    - dro_endpoint_url is not defined or dro_endpoint_url == ""


# 2. Generate the DRO configuration for MAS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- include_tasks: tasks/gencfg/main.yml
  when:
    - dro_action == "install_dro"
    - mas_instance_id is defined and mas_instance_id != ""
    - mas_config_dir is defined and mas_config_dir != ""
